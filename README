DyNeMoC is statistical model checker for agent based systems on graphs. 

System Requirements.
JDK 1.8 or plus
Python 2.7 with igraph, and numpy libraries


Steps to run the Simulation:

1.Run Graph_Generation/graph_generation.py
  cd Graph_Generation
  python graph_generation.py

2. Run Generate_Input/GenInput.java
   cd Generate_Input
   javac GenInput.java
   java GenInput

3. Run DyNeMoC/testDyNeMoC.java 
   cd DyNeMoC
   javac testDyNeMoC.java
   /usr/bin/time -v java testDyNeMoC


Important: To run the simulation for different agents, first you have to set the num_people parameter in Config/config.properties, and Graph_Generation/Hstratconfig.py then follow the above 3 steps.

Note: To check the simulation results in different program execution strategies, you have to run strategy.sh. You can see the strategy/sample_ouput.png for sample output of these stragies.

4. Run strategy.sh 
   ./strategy.sh
